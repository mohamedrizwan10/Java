CONCURRENTLY - RUN MULTIPLE PROGRAM AT A TIME  OR SYSTEM CAN DO MORE THAN ONE PROGRAM
*PROCESS BASED TWO OR MORE PROGRAM CONCURRENTLY
*THREAD BASED IN ONE PROGRAM , TASKS CONCURRENTLY

#PROCESSES
A PROCESS HAS A SELF CONTAINED EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT[VLC,MSOFFICE]

MULTITASKING:
MULTIPLE PROCESSES

DOING MANY TASKS AT A TIME using different processess
SINGLE THREAD:SINGLE TASK:JOB

JVM:SINGLE PROCESS
CONCURRENTLY

IN CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING THERE ARE TWO BASIC UNITS OF EXECUTION : PROCESS AND THREADS
IN JAVA PRG LANG CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING IS MOSTLY CONCERNED WITH THREADS

DOING SAME THINGS AT SAME TIME INSIDE A SINGLE PROCESS
MULTITHREADING: LIGHT WEIGHTED
MULTITHREADING IS A SUBTASK 

MULTITASKING                                                 MULTITHREADING
PROCESSES ARE HEAVY WEIGHTED                                 PROCESSES ARE LIGHT WEIGHT    
SEPRATE ADDRESS SPACE                                        SAME ADDRESS SPACE 
COSTLY                                                       CHEAPER

BY EXTENDING THREAD CLASS
BY IMPLEMENTING RUNNABLE INTERFACE


YIELD IS USED TO WAIT

ONCE THE CHILD THREAD IS FINISHED THEN MAIN THREAD WILL EXECUTED
ct.join();
